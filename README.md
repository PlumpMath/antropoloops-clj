# antropoloops MAP

#### This is a work in progress!

*Needs OSCLive from http://livecontrol.q3f.org/ableton-liveapi/liveosc/ to be installed within Ableton. Complete List of OSC calls at http://monome.q3f.org/browser/trunk/LiveOSC/OSCAPI.txt*

*antropoloops MAP* is an application made with [clojure](https://clojure.org/) for [antropoloops] (http://antropoloops.tumblr.com/), a musical project that creates sound collages with fragments of other songs, mixing melodies and rhythms from different times and territories. The aim of the application is to make the mix more transparent and give visibility to the sources that compose it.

*antropoloops MAP* is structured to receive data from the session in [ableton live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/new-in-9/) via [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) and display it live on screen. The application shows the location and year of each loop recording, and the album covers of the original songs. It also shows the main fields of the mp3 ID3 tag (title, album and artist).

Here's a couple of videos to see the application running:
